============================
Scheduler Index Data Sources
============================

In order to create Scheduler Index exporters, a data
source that gives access to the Scheduler indexing server for the Denodo
Platform needs to be defined by specifying the following parameters:

-  **Host**. Machine name in which the Scheduler Index server will run.
-  **Port**. Port number for the Scheduler Index server.
-  **Username**. Username for connecting to the Scheduler Index server.
-  **Password**. Password associated with the specified user.

.. note:: Until this version of Denodo Scheduler, these data sources 
   were named as *ARN-Index*.
