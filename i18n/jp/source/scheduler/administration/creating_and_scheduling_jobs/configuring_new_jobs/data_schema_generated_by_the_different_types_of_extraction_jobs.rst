All the extraction jobs (but VDPCache) return the following fields in

   was first executed,

.. important:: Regarding to Aracne jobs, they are deprecated and will be removed in a later version of the Denodo Platform. 
   No new Aracne jobs can be created in version 7.0, but you could edit and run the existing ones. 
   You can see the documentation of the data schema generated by these jobs from `previous version <https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/6.0/scheduler/administration/creating_and_scheduling_jobs/configuring_new_jobs/data_schema_generated_by_the_different_types_of_extraction_jobs>`_.
 

Regarding to the rest of the extraction jobs (ITP, JDBC, and VDP), all
the fields retrieved from their respective data sources are added.
