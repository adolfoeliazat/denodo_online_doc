Support for Dependencies
====================================================

The Eclipse projects linked to a Denodo application in a particular debug configuration (see :ref:`Denodo Application debug configuration` for more information) 
may have dependencies. Those dependencies (other Eclipse projects, or even external jar files) will be automatically linked to the selected Denodo application, 
so all the necessary classes will be found at runtime.
