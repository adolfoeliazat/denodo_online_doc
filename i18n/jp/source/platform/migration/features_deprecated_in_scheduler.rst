Features Deprecated in Scheduler 7.0
============================================================================

Due to the introduction of new features or changes in existing ones, some features of Denodo that 
are available in previous versions have been deprecated.

Deprecated features are supported in the current version. However, they are not actively maintained and may be removed in the next major version 
of the Denodo Platform. We *strongly* recommend planning to stop using deprecated features.

This section lists the features that are currently deprecated in Denodo Scheduler |version|.
This list is updated whenever a feature is marked as deprecated.

**Last update of this list**: |today|.
