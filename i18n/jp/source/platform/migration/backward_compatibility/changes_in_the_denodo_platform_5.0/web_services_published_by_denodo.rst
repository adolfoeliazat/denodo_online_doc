Web Services Published by Denodo
================================

Starting with Denodo 5.0, the option **Pretty XML Output** of published
Web services is global for all the operations the Web service. When
editing a published Web service imported from 4.7, if any operation had
enabled the option Pretty XML Output, the Pretty XML Output option is
enabled for the entire Web service.
