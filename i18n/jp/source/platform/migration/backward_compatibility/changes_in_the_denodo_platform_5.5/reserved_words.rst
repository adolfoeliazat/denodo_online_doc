Reserved Words
==============

Virtual DataPort 5.5 defines new reserved words (i.e. words that cannot
be used as a view’s name or a field’s name). Therefore, you may have
views in your current version that cannot be created in Virtual DataPort
5.5. The figure :ref:`Basic primitives for specifying VQL statements` of the 
VQL Guide lists the reserved words of Virtual
DataPort.
