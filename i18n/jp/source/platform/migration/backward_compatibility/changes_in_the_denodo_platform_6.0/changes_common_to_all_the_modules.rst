Logging: Clearer Format for Dates
============================================================================

Starting with Denodo 6.0, by default, all the modules use a date pattern
to write the dates of logs messages. With the new pattern, the dates are
easier to read

The new default format is

<year>-<month>-<day of month>T<hour>:<minute>:<second>.<millisecond>.

For example, 2016-03-14T15:09:26.536.

In previous versions, the format is

<year><month><day><hour><minute><second><millisecond>.

For example, 20160314150926536.

If you have tools that automatically process the logs generated by
Denodo, you can either change the date pattern in all the log4j.xml
files of the directory :file:`{<DENODO_HOME_6_0>}/conf` or modify the
configuration of the application that processes these logs.
