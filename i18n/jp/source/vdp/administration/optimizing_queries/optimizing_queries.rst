This section describes different aspects of interest in relation to the
optimizing of queries in Virtual DataPort:

-  Decreasing the processing time of delimited files: see section
   :ref:`Optimizing DF Data Sources`.
-  Optimizing join operations by selecting the most suitable join method
   for a view or a query: see section :ref:`Optimizing Join Operations`.
-  How the Execution Engine automatically tries to simplify the queries
   before executing them: see section :ref:`Automatic Simplification of
   Queries`.
-  How the cost-based optimization works and the benefits of enabling
   it: see section :ref:`Cost-Based Optimization`.
-  How the “data movement” optimization can improve the performance of
   queries that involve a lot of data: see section :ref:`Data Movement`.
-  How the “parallel processing” optimization allows Denodo to work with
   massive parallel processing engines (MPP) to accelerate the execution of 
   queries: see section :ref:`Parallel Processing`.
