Source Refresh
==============

The Source Refresh option updates a base view, reflecting the changes in
the underlying data source. To refresh a base view, follow these steps:

#. Double-click the base view on the Server Explorer.
#. Click **Edit**.
#. Click **Source Refresh** (|image0|).

If the modifications in the base view affect other views, the
Administration Tool will display a dialog with a list of the affected
views. Select which views you want to propagate these changes to, by
selecting the check boxes that appears right before each view’s names
(select the header’s check box to select all the views in the list)

After accepting the changes, the views left in an incorrect state will
be marked with the icon |image1|, in the Server Explorer.
