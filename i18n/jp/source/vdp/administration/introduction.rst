Nowadays, any organization of a certain importance makes use of a
multitude of data sources developed over a period of time. Generally,
these data sources are developed using different technologies
(relational databases, Web services, XML documents, spreadsheets, flat
files, etc.), using very heterogeneous data models, and include both
structured and non-structured data.

Development of new services for clients and/or optimization of company
business processes require the new systems built to integrate the data
stored in these inherited data repositories. In addition, it is often
needed to access external data sources to interact with partners,
providers or customers. The Web itself is also a very valuable
information source for many business purposes.

**Virtual DataPort** is a **global solution** for the real-time
integration of heterogeneous, distributed, structured and
semi-structured data sources. For this, it combines various features:

-  Integrates and manages the data that are relevant to the company,
   regardless of its origin and format.
-  It incorporates these data into its data system, in real time or with
   configurable preloads.
-  Facilitates the construction of distributed information services with
   high strategic and functional value.

This document provides a technical guide to the use of Virtual DataPort.
