========================================
Setting the User Agent of an Application
========================================

The user agent is an attribute of the connections to Virtual DataPort.
This attribute is a string that has to be set by the client
applications.

There are several places that display the user agent of the connections:

-  Virtual DataPort publishes several MBeans with information about
   which application opened each connection, performed a request, etc.
   These MBeans have the attribute ``userAgent``.
-  The logs generated by the Denodo Monitor.
-  The Query Monitor of the administration tool (“Tools” menu)

We recommend setting the user agent attribute from your client
applications because it will help you identify the requests performed by
a particular application. This is very useful for debugging problems
caused by a particular client or for logging purposes.

The user agent is set in a different way depending on the type of
client:

-  JDBC clients: add the parameter ``userAgent`` to the JDBC URL. For
   example,

   .. code-block:: none
   
      jdbc:vdb://localhost:9999/testing?userAgent=MyApplication

   Alternatively, you can add ``userAgent`` as a driver property instead of
   a parameter of the URL.

-  ODBC clients:

   -  For a DSN created on Windows, see the section :ref:`Set Up a DSN on Windows` of the Developer Guide.
   -  For a DSN created on Linux, see the section :ref:`Register a Data Source (DSN) on UnixODBC`
      of the Developer Guide.


-  JMS clients: set the property ``userAgent`` in the JMS message. For
   example:

.. code-block:: java

   javax.jms.TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(QUERY);
   message.setStringProperty("userAgent", "userAgentValueJMS");

   
-  Administration tool: open the dialog **Connection** on the menu **Tools > Admin Tool preferences** and change the value of the box **User agent**.

-  The RESTful web service, REST and SOAP web services: the value of the HTTP header ``User-Agent`` of the requests is passed along with the statements these services execute in the Virtual DataPort server.

The user agent is not configurable for other types of clients.
