==============================
Security and Access Privileges
==============================

Authentication in the generic RESTful Web Service is done through the
HTTP basic method. It is recommended to configure the use of HTTPS to
provide further security. The sections :doc:`Obtaining and Installing an SSL/TLS Certificate </platform/installation/postinstallation_tasks/enable_ssl_connections_in_the_denodo_platform_servers/obtaining_and_installing_an_ssl_certificate>`
and :ref:`Enabling Https in the Embedded Apache Tomcat` 
of the Installation Guide explain how to setup the
HTTPS support.

Virtual DataPort privileges apply in the usual way.
