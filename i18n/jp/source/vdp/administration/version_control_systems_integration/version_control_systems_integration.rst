Version Control Systems Integration
===================================

Version Control Systems (VCS) integration allows users to do the main
tasks involved in version control from the Administration Tool: check
out / update and check in / commit of databases and individual elements.

VCS support is integrated with the features for managing the metadata of
the Denodo installations used at different points of the software
deployment lifecycle (e.g. development, staging, production) and/or at
different geographical locations. In Denodo, this concept is named
“Environment Management”.

Before using the VCS integration, you have to perform the
post-installation tasks described in the section :ref:`Configuring the VCS
Clients` 
of the Installation Guide.
