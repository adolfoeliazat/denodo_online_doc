This section describes various key concepts in the Virtual DataPort
architecture:

-  :ref:`Databases in Virtual DataPort` describes the concept of
   *databases* in the context of a Virtual DataPort server. That is,
   logical groupings of data sources, views, stored procedures and other
   elements in the Server.

-  :ref:`User and Access Right in Virtual DataPort` describes the
   general concepts of user and access rights management in Virtual DataPort.

-  :ref:`Administration of Databases, Users, Roles and
   their Access Rights` describes how to manage this structure using the
   Administration Tool.
