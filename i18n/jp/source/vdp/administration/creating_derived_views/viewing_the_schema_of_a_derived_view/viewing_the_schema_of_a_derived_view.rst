====================================
Viewing the Schema of a Derived View
====================================

To view the schema of a view, double-click it in the Server Explorer. In
addition to the options available for base views (see section :ref:`Creating
Derived Views`), we also have:

-  **Tree View**: see section :ref:`Tree View`
-  **Data Lineage**: see section :ref:`Data Lineage`

Click **Edit** to open the “Edit view” dialog. The Tool will open the
dialog that corresponds to the operation used to create the view (i.e.
join, union, etc.). In this dialog, you can do the following:

-  Rename the view.
-  Rename the view’s attributes.
-  Modify its specific parameters. For example, for join views you can
   change the join conditions, projected fields, etc.

Alternatively, you can replace the view with another one with the same
name (see section :ref:`Editing / Replacing a View` for more details about
edition/replacement of views).
