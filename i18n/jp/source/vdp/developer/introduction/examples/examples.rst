In the :file:`{<DENODO_HOME>}/samples/vdp/` directory, there are several
examples of clients that retrieve data from Virtual DataPort:

-  ``vdp-clients`` contains sample programs that connect to Virtual
   DataPort through the JDBC interface and a SOAP Web service.
-  ``vdp-clients-ADO.NET`` contains a C# program that, using an
   ADO.Net data provider, it connects directly to the ODBC interface of Virtual DataPort or
   through a Windows ODBC DSN. Then, it executes a
   query.
-  ``vdp-clients-C++`` contains C++ program that connects to
   Virtual DataPort through the ODBC interface and executes a query.
-  ``vdp-clients-EntityFramework`` contains a C# program that sends
   a query to Virtual DataPort, using the Entity Framework.

See more about these examples in the ``README`` file of these
directories.
