=====================
Access Through OLE DB
=====================

OLE DB (Object Linking and Embedding, Database) is an API designed by
Microsoft that allows accessing data from a variety of sources in a
uniform manner.

The Denodo Platform does not include an OLE DB adapter but our partner
`Intellisoft <https://www.pgoledb.com/>`_ provides one. Please contact them for further information.
