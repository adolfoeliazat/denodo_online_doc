Denodo4E, an Eclipse plug-in which provides tools for creating,
debugging and deploying Denodo extensions: custom filters, custom functions,
stored procedures and custom wrappers.

We strongly recommend using this plugin to develop these extensions because it adds the required libraries to the classpath of the project, provides the capability of debugging the extension you are developing, etc.

The :ref:`Denodo4E User Guide` explains how to use it.
