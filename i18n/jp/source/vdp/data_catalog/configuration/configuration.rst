In this tab, every user can configure the internationalization (i18n)
settings. If you select the **Internationalize results** check box, the
results of the executed queries will be internationalized.

Internationalization configuration specifies aspects such as time zones and decimal separators. The following data types will be
formatted according to the selected i18n:

-  Float, Double and Decimal values: decimal separators may vary in
   different internationalization configurations.
-  Date values: the format used to represent dates is different in each
   internationalization configuration.
