As explained before, the purpose of the *Browse* menu is to find a view or web service by navigating through the different types of elements: databases, categories or tags.

When you reach a web service and you click on its name, the tool will display these tabs:

-  **Summary**: see section :ref:`Summary of Web Services`.
-  **Query**: see section :ref:`Query a Web Service`.

In addition, if the web service has some :ref:`custom properties groups assigned <Assigning Custom Properties>`, their custom properties will be shown in the same way as they are shown in the :ref:`views <Views>`.

The button to edit the web service is only visible if the user has administration privileges.
