**Virtual DataPort** is a **global solution** for heterogeneous and
dispersed data source integration in real time.

Virtual DataPort uses VQL (Virtual Query Language) as Data Definition
and Data Manipulation Language. VQL allows creating and updating the
elements that constitute the system catalog, as well as querying and
updating the unified information views. VQL is highly compatible with
SQL but it also includes specific constructions to deal with the
particularities of a virtual information integration system.

This document describes VQL and how to use it to perform Virtual
DataPort administration tasks. It is important to remark that it is not
usually needed to write VQL scripts manually. The :doc:`/vdp/administration/index` describes how to perform 
the most usual administration tasks using the Administration Tool.

.. note::
   We strongly recommend using the Administration Tool for all the
   administration tasks.
