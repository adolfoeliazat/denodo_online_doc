==================
Comparing Literals
==================

The comparison of ``text`` values is case-sensitive. That is, when
comparing literals with the operators ``=``, ``<>``, ``<``, ``>``,
``<=`` and ``>=``, in the ``ORDER BY`` clause, when evaluating the join
conditions involving values of type ``text``, etc., the case of the
value is taken into account.
