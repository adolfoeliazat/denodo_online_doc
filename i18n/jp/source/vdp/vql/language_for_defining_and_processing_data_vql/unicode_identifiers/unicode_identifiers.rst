===================
Unicode Identifiers
===================

Virtual DataPort supports Unicode characters in the name of most of its
elements databases, user names, roles, data sources, wrappers, views and
their fields, etc.

By default, the Unicode support is disabled and can be enabled for the
entire Server or just for some of its databases.

The section :ref:`Identifiers Charset` of the Administration Guide explains
the following:

-  The difference between the two available char sets: “Unicode” and
   “Restricted”.
-  How changing this affects the user.
-  How to enable or disable this support.
