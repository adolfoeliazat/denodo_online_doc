Logical Operators
=================

Logical operators are used to create Boolean expressions (which are
evaluated as ``true`` or ``false``) typically used in a ``WHERE``
clause. The logical operators supported are:

-  ``AND``: Is the logical “and”. Evaluates two conditions and returns a
   true value only if both are correct.
-  ``OR``: Is the logical “or”. Evaluates two conditions and returns a
   true value, if one of the two is correct.
-  ``NOT``: Is the logical negation. It is applied to a condition and
   negates its value.
