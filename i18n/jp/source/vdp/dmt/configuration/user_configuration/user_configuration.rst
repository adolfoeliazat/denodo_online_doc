In the Diagnostic & Monitoring Tool, each user account has its own
settings regarding how the information is displayed.

To modify your configuration, click **Options** > **User configuration**.
Change all the settings you want and click **Save**. To apply the new
settings to the opened tabs, you need to reload them.

To restore the default settings, click **Options** > **Load default user
configuration**.

Each tab of the configuration is grouped in the sections that can be
expanded/collapsed by clicking their title.

There are two types of sections:

#. Sections that control which series of the graphs are available. The
   fields of the cleared check boxes will not be visible.
#. Sections that control the fields displayed by a table. You can drag
   the fields to change the order in which they appear in the table.

The following subsections explain the options available in each tab.
