In the documentation of the Denodo Platform you will find all the information you need to 
build Data Virtualization solutions.

.. important:: If you are migrating from an earlier version of Denodo, after installing the new version, you have to follow the steps of the :doc:`Migration Guide </platform/migration/index>`. The VQL statements generated by Denodo 6.0 cannot be imported into Denodo 7.0 without setting certain properties first on the Denodo 6.0 server.

.. note:: The user manuals were updated on |today|. See the :ref:`latest changes <What Is New in Denodo 7.0 update 20190903>`.

Introduction
============

The Denodo Platform is a data virtualization system that allows 
applications to use data from multiple, heterogeneous data sources.

Data is accessed and integrated in real-time 
across distributed data sources without copying or moving data from its source.

   General architecture of the Denodo Platform

The Denodo Platform is comprised of these modules:

+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Virtual DataPort** | The main module of the Denodo Platform. This is the module where         |
|                      | developers create "virtual views" that integrate data from multiple      |
|                      | sources: databases, SAP BW servers, XML files, JSON files, CSV files,    |
|                      | etc.                                                                     |
|                      |                                                                          | 
|                      | Virtual DataPort provides several ways to query these virtual views:     |
|                      |                                                                          |
|                      | -  A JDBC and an ODBC driver                                             |
|                      | -  By publishing SOAP and REST web services                              |
|                      | -  ...                                                                   |
|                      |                                                                          |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **ITPilot**          | Provides an easy way to access, structure and query data present in the  |
|                      | Web.                                                                     |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Scheduler**        | Enables you to schedule jobs to interact with the                        |
|                      | other modules of the Denodo Platform. For example,                       |
|                      | send queries to Virtual DataPort at a particular                         |
|                      | moment and process its result.                                           |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Installation
============
   
The :doc:`Installation Guide </platform/installation/index>` explains how to install the Denodo Platform.

.. important:: If you are upgrading from a previous version of the Denodo Platform, 
   read the :doc:`Migration Guide </platform/migration/index>`. It explains how to import the existing configuration to the new version.
   In addition, it provides information about backward compatibility and changes in the new release.

Virtual DataPort
================

The documentation of Virtual DataPort is divided in five documents:

1. :doc:`/vdp/administration/index`

   -  It presents the fundamental concepts of the Data Virtualization.
   
   -  It explains how to use the Virtual DataPort administration tool to build 
      unified views of data from distributed and heterogeneous sources.
      
   -  It explains how to configure and manage the Virtual DataPort server.

#. :doc:`/vdp/developer/index`
   
   -  How to access a Virtual DataPort server using the Denodo JDBC and ODBC drivers
      to query Denodo from your applications.

   -  How to use the API provided Virtual DataPort to develop custom extensions: 
      stored procedures, wrappers to new sources, functions, security policies and filters.

#. :doc:`/vdp/vql/index`

   -  It is a reference manual for the VQL language (Virtual Query Language).
    
      VQL and is the language provided by Virtual DataPort to query views,
      manage elements in Virtual DataPort (data sources, views, web services, etc.) 
      and perform programmatically almost any of the tasks 
      that you can perform from the administration tool.
   
      VQL is highly compatible with SQL.
   
#. :doc:`/vdp/data_catalog/index`

   -  The *Data Catalog* is a web application targeted at 
      business users to query, search and browse information and
      metainformation of a Virtual DataPort server.   
   
#. :doc:`/vdp/dmt/index`

   -  Explains how to use the *Diagnostic & Monitoring Tool* to: 
   
      a. Display the real time status of one or more Virtual DataPort servers
      
      b. Diagnose past issues by processing the log files generated by Virtual DataPort.

Scheduler
================

The :doc:`Scheduler Administration Guide </scheduler/administration/index>` explains how to use
the Denodo Scheduler.

ITPilot
================

The documentation of Virtual DataPort is divided in five documents:

1. :doc:`Generation Environment Guide </itpilot/generation_environment/index>`

   -  Describes how to use the ITPilot Wrapper Generation Tool. With this tool you can graphically
      create *wrappers* that extract data. These are flows comprising different 
      components; each component applies a specific function on a group of 
      inputs and produces one output.
      
   -  Explains how to deploy the generated wrappers in the ITPilot running environment.   

#. :doc:`Developer Guide </itpilot/developer/index>`:
   
   -  Explains how to develop applications that use the wrappers generated with Denodo ITPilot.
   
   -  Describes how to use the API offered by Denodo ITPilot.
   
   -  Explains how to create custom ITPilot functions.

   
#. :doc:`ITPilot DEXTL Guide </itpilot/dextl/index>`

   -  Provides a reference of the DEXTL 
      (Data Extraction Language) language, which allows you to extract data from HTML pages.
   
      Usually you do not need to create DEXTL programs manually because with the 
      ITPilot Generation Environment, you can create DEXTL programs graphically in a simpler way.    
      Nevertheless, this manual provides an exhaustive description of the language for advanced users. 

#. :doc:`ITPilot NSEQL Guide </itpilot/nseql/index>` 

   -  Describes in detail the 
      automated NSEQL language (Navigation SEQuence Language) used in Denodo ITPilot.
   
#. :doc:`ITPilot User Guide </itpilot/user_guide/index>`:

   -  Provides an introduction to Denodo ITPilot.
   -  Describes the functioning environments of Denodo ITPilot
   -  The configuration of each of the Denodo ITPilot components in the execution and verification environments.

Solution Manager
================

The documentation of the Solution Manager is divided in three documents:

1. :doc:`Solution Manager Installation Guide </solution_manager/installation/index>`. 

#. :doc:`Solution Manager Administration Guide </solution_manager/administration/index>`

   -  Explains how to manage clusters of Denodo servers using this tool.
   -  Explains how to manage the licenses used by these servers from this tool instead of having to manage them server by server.

#. :doc:`Web Panel Guide </solution_manager/web_panel/index>`.

   -  Explains how to use and configure the Web Panel Administration Tool.

.. important:: Two modules of the Denodo Platform have been deprecated and may be removed in the next major version of the Denodo Platform.

   -  :doc:`Aracne </platform/migration/backward_compatibility/changes_in_the_denodo_platform_7.0/aracne>`
   -  ITPilot Verification Server
