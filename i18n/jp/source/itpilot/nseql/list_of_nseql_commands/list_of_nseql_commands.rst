Subsection :ref:`Usual Parameters` describes in more detail some parameters that are
common to a high number of commands. The following subsections
respectively deal with each of the command groups mentioned. The order
in each group is alphabetical. For each command, the function is
described briefly as well as the parameters it should receive and the
value returned as a result of its execution. This output value can be
useful in debugging and is shown in its execution trace by the ITPilot
generation environment tools that allow NSEQL programs
to be generated and executed.
