Extensions
==============

The Extensions section allows displaying, adding and deleting the
extensions that are installed in the server. The extensions are JAR
files that add new functionality to the standard Denodo Platform (more
information about how to create extensions is available in the :doc:`/itpilot/developer/index`).



The currently installed extensions are displayed in a list. For each
extension, the name of the JAR file that contains the extension is
shown, along with the list of elements that the extension adds to the
server.



To add a new extension from the web administration tool, the user should
click on the “Load extension” button and then select the file by
clicking on the “Choose File…” button, and finally click on the “Load”
button. The extension will be installed and will appear in the list.



To delete an extension, the user can click on its |image0| button. It is
also possible to delete several extensions at the same time by marking
the check boxes to the left of their respective entries in the extensions
list and clicking on the button |image1|, that is located in the list
header. Marking the topmost check box, the one with the label “All/None”,
will select all the extensions currently visible in the list.
