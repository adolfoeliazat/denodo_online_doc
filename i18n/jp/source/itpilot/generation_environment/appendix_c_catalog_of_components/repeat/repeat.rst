Repeat

.. rubric:: Description

This component allows for repeat loops to be made in the flow. The loop
is repeated until the given condition is not met (therefore, it is a
loop of type DOâ€¦ WHILE). The difference between the Repeat and Loop
components is that the Loop component checks the loop condition before
executing the iterations, and the Repeat component checks the condition
after finishing each iteration.

.. rubric:: Input Parameters

Repeat accepts zero or more values, zero or more records, zero or more
lists and zero or more pages as input. These elements are used to assign
variables to the loop output condition expression; functions available
to define this condition are defined in Appendix A.

.. rubric:: Output Values

None.

.. rubric:: Example

This component works in a very similar manner to Loop; therefore, please
see the example of the :ref:`Loop` component.
