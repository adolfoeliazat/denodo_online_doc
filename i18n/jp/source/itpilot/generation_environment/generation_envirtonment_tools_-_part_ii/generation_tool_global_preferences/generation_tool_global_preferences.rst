==================================
Generation Tool Global Preferences
==================================

From the dialog shown after selecting the option Tools->Preferences from
the tool main menu, there exists a set of parameters that can be
configured and that globally affect the process generation. The dialog
has the following tabs:

#. General
   
   a. Default Wrapper Locale: it allows configuring the default locale
      assigned to a wrapper when it is created. The locale of the wrapper
      is used by its Init component to type the values of the wrapper input
      parameters, and it is also used as the locale set to the base views
      when deploying wrappers to the Virtual DataPort server (see
      :ref:`Deploying Wrappers to the Wrapper Server`). This value can be modified, after creating
      the wrapper, through the “Options” button from the button area (at
      the lower right corner of the working area). Please see section :doc:`../../generation_envirtonment_tools_-_part_ii/wrapper_advanced_options_specific_browser_pool_and_locale/locale` for more information.
   b. Default locale for Extractor components: it allows configuring the
      default locale that will be assigned automatically to Extractor
      components when they are created. This value can be modified for
      specific wrappers (useful when all or most of the Extractor
      components of this wrapper will require a different locale) through
      the “Options” button from the button area (please see section :doc:`../../generation_envirtonment_tools_-_part_ii/wrapper_advanced_options_specific_browser_pool_and_locale/locale` for more information). The locale assigned to an Extractor
      component can be modified, after creating the component, through its
      wizard (see :ref:`Locale configuration of the Extractor component`).
   c. Auto-generated Scanner Configuration: as it will be explained in
      section :ref:`Tagsets and Scanners`, ITPilot requires the use of a
      scanner for extracting data from web pages. ITPilot provides a
      graphical scanner generation tool, but it also allows the possibility
      of generating a scanner automatically from the page characteristics,
      and the examples provided by the user to generate a specification.
      The scanners are generated from what it is known as “lexer types” or
      “skeletons”. In the Preferences dialog, ITPilot allows the user to
      choose the lexer type to be used as a base for auto-generated
      scanners. Most applications will not need to modify the default lexer
      type. Please see section :ref:`Tagsets and scanners included in the
      distribution` to obtain a description of the available lexer types
      and how convenient it can be to use one or another.
   d. Temp directory: allows specifying a directory to store temporal data
      like the for example, the HTML documents generated by PDF, Word and
      Excel converters. Also, the :doc:`../../appendix_c_catalog_of_components/savefile/savefile` component
      saves files to this directory if no particular directory is specified
      in the component configuration.


#. Browser pool. The generation tool uses a browser management system, or
   “pool” that is used to test the generated wrapper. The configurable
   features are the following:


   a. Configuration.

      i. Default type of browser. It allows to define the type of browser to be
         used (see section :ref:`Comparison between MSIE and Denodo Browser` for more
         information about when to use a particular type of browser):


         -  MSIE Browser: Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.
         -  Denodo Browser: Denodo http client able to manage JavaScript.

         The type of browser will determine what settings are available to
         configure.

   b. Browser controls.


      i.   Maximum download time. Maximum time (in milliseconds) that a
           browser will wait to download a page.
      ii.  Object timeout. Maximum time (in milliseconds) that a browser can
           be in use outside of the pool to serve a request of a web process.
           After that time has finished, the browser is destroyed. If the
           value of this parameter is lesser than 0, the browser can stay
           outside of the pool indefinitely.
      iii. Show graphical interface (only for MSIE Browser). If selected, the
           browsers will show their graphical interface. To optimize the
           efficiency of the system, an application in a production
           environment should not show the browser graphical interface.
           However, it can be useful to change the value of this option for
           debugging purposes.
      iv.  Silent (only for MSIE Browser). If selected, the browser will
           automatically close all the JavaScript dialogs that appear during
           the execution of a navigation sequence.

   c. Download controls. This set of parameters specifies what kinds of
      contents might be downloaded by the browsers of the pool. The content
      types which download can be configured are:


      i.  MSIE Browser: images, videos, background sounds, script programs,
          Java applets and ActiveX components.
      ii. Denodo Browser: script programs.

   d. Cache controls. This group of parameters is for specifying whether or
      not the browser pool should use the local cache and/or–in the case of
      MSIE Browser–the proxy cache. In the case of Denodo Browser, the maximum
      number of JavaScript files that may be found in the cache can be
      configured by means of the “Maximum number of cached JavaScript files”
      parameter.

   e. Proxy: this set of parameters allows configuring browsers that must
      access internet through a proxy server. Specifically, the following
      parameters can be configured:


      i.   Login: proxy user.
      ii.  Password: password for the proxy user.
      iii. Domain (Windows 2000): Windows domain.

   f. Pool Size and reutilization policy: this area allows users to configure
      the pool size and the browser reuse strategy.
      
      i.   Max. Pool Size: maximum number of browsers in the pool.
      ii.  Min. Pool Size: minimum number of browsers. The system will not
           reuse browsers already existing in the pool, unless the current
           number is equal to or greater than the value of this parameter.
      iii. Max. Browser TTL: Maximum Time to Live of a persistent browser. If
           a persistent browser is active more than the specified time, it
           will be removed and a new one will be created with the same page
           loaded as the former browser. This is useful because, due to known
           problems in some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer, when
           using this type of browser, performance may degrade if the browser
           has been open for too long. This option only applies to persistent
           browsers, not regular ones (see :ref:`Create Persistent Browser` for
           details about persistent browsers).
      iv.  Reusable Browsers: indicates if the browser pool can be reused to
           deal with more than one request. Enabling browser reusability
           increases the efficiency of most applications; however, it may not
           be suitable in cases where dealing with a previous request changes
           the browser response to subsequent requests (for example, through
           the use of cookies).

3. Document conversion: the installation process of the Denodo Platform
   allows configuring the converters from PDF and Word/Excel to HTML. It is
   also possible to configure these same parameters from the preferences
   dialog:

   a. PDF to HTML Converter: allows to configure the PDF-to-HTML converter to
      be used by default. The types of converters currently available are:
   
      i.   Acrobat Text: uses the plain text conversion tool of the Adobe
           Acrobat Professional software, from which ITPilot generates an HTML
           file (it is required for the Adobe product to be installed).
      ii.  Acrobat HTML: uses the HTML conversion tool of the Adobe Acrobat
           Professional software (it is required for the Adobe product to be
           installed).
      iii. PDFBox 0.7.3 and PDFBox 1.x: PDFBox (`Apache PDFBox - A Java PDF Library <https://pdfbox.apache.org/>`_) is used to generate the HTML
           page. Version 1.x of PDFBox (currently version 1.6) is available
           since ITPilot 4.7; version 0.7.3 was included in previous releases
           of ITPilot and is still available.

   b. Conversion server port: port where the PDF conversion Server is
      listening. By default: 8448.

   c. Acrobat Prof. Plugin directory: location of the Adobe Acrobat
      Professional plugins directory. The plugins required to use Acrobat
      Pro’s conversion capabilities are stored in this directory.


   d. OpenOffice Directory: location of the OpenOffice installation, used in
      the Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to HTML conversion.

   e. Remove the temporal files generated by the PDF, Word and Excel
      converters: if selected, the temporal html files generated in document
      conversions are deleted when the wrapper ends its execution. If it is
      not selected, the files will remain in the temporal directory.
