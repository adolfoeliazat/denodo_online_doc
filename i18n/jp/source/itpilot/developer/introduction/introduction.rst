Introduction

Denodo ITPilot enables to extract
and structure the data present in Web sources. This process is carried
out by constructing an abstraction of the target Web source called a
“wrapper” that frees the client applications of the difficulties
associated with accessing and extracting the required data.



ITPilot provides a distributed and scalable environment for generating,
executing and maintaining “wrappers”. See the :doc:`/itpilot/user_guide/index` and the :doc:`/itpilot/generation_environment/index` for more
information on how to create, install and maintain wrappers using Denodo
ITPilot.



This manual describes the Java development API that allows creating
clients that use wrappers that have already been generated and
installed. The basic guidelines for using the API are given, the main
components are described and some examples of use are provided. See the
Javadoc documentation for more details on classes, attributes and operations.



Besides, this manual explains how to create ITPilot custom functions.
