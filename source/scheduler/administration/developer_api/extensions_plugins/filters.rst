Filters
=======

.. important:: Filter sequences are deprecated and will be removed in a later version of the Denodo Platform. 
   No new filter sequences can be created in version 7.0, but you could edit the existing ones. 
   If you still want to implement a new filter to use from an existent filter sequence, you can see the documentation from 
   `previous version <https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/6.0/scheduler/administration/developer_api/extensions_plugins/filters>`_.
