================

.. important:: Filter sequences are deprecated and will be removed in a later version of the Denodo Platform. 
   No new filter sequences can be created in version 7.0, but you could edit the existing ones. 
   You can see the documentation about filter sequences and all type of filters from `previous version <https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/6.0/scheduler/administration/creating_and_scheduling_jobs/filter_sequences/filter_sequences>`_.
