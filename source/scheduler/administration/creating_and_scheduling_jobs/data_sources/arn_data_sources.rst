ARN Data Sources
================

.. important:: Aracne sources are deprecated and will be removed in a later version of the Denodo Platform. 
   No new Aracne data sources can be created in version 7.0, but you could edit and use the existing ones. 
   You can see the documentation from `previous version <https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/6.0/scheduler/administration/creating_and_scheduling_jobs/data_sources/arn_data_sources>`_.
