Log Configuration
=================

The logs configuration files for the server is in the path
``DENODO_HOME/conf/scheduler`` (where ``DENODO_HOME`` specifies the
basic installation path). These files are based on 
`Apache Log4j 2 <http://logging.apache.org/log4j/>`_. Among other possibilities, they let
you change the path where the *log* files are stored and the *log* level
for the categories defined in the application. For more information
please refer to the documentation of Log4j.

 

The Web administration tool also has a configuration file ``log4j2.xml``
to establish the register level of the events generated by this
application. This file is found in the directory
``DENODO_HOME/resources/apache-tomcat/webapps/webadmin/denodo-scheduler-admin/WEB-INF/classes``.

 

By default, the Scheduler server logs all the triggersâ€™ activity (when a
trigger is fired, when it is completed and when it is misfired). It is
useful to analyze when a job is actually launched or if it is not
launched when expected, when testing scheduling strategies. However, if
you do not want this information to be logged, you can disable it by
deleting the log category *org.quartz.plugins* (or changing the log
level to *error*).

 

The Scheduler server stores the logging messages in the file :file:`{<DENODO_HOME>}/logs/scheduler/scheduler.log`.

The Scheduler administration tool stores the logging messages in the file :file:`{<DENODO_HOME>}/logs/scheduler/scheduler-admin.log`.
