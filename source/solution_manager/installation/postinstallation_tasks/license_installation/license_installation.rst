====================
Install the License
====================

You need to install the license file provided by Denodo. If you did not provide it during the installation or
you want to use a different one, do one of the following:

a. Open the Denodo Control Center, click **Help**, click **Install license** and select the license file.
#. Or rename the desired license file to ``denodo.lic`` and
   copy it to the directory :file:`{<SOLUTION_MANAGER_HOME>}/conf`.

Without a valid license file, the Solution Manager modules will not
start.
