=============================================================
Enabling SSL/TLS for External Clients of the Solution Manager
=============================================================

.. todo: In Denodo 8.0, remove this page because it does not add anything.

The section :ref:`Enabling SSL/TLS for External Clients` of the Installation Guide explains how to connect to the JDBC interface of the Virtual DataPort, in the Solution Manager.

.. note:: This **does not** apply to clients that connect to the http/https interface of the Solution Manager servers. It only applies to clients that connect to the standard interface. E.g. the script "ping" of the "bin" folder, the Denodo Monitor, etc.
