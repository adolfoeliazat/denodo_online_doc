===============================================================

This section explains the backward and forward compatibility between the Solution Manager and the Denodo Platform servers (Virtual DataPort, Scheduler...).

-  The Solution Manager |version| with the Jun 2018 update (20180611) or later is compatible with Denodo Platform servers |version| with the Jun 2018 update (20180611) or later.

-  The Denodo Platform servers |version| with the Jun 2018 update (20180611) or later are compatible with the Solution Manager |version| with the Jun 2018 update (20180611) or later.

.. note:: The Solution Manager and the Denodo Platform servers are both backward and forward compatible with each other, as long as they both have the Jun, 2018 update (20180611) or later. That is, the Solution Manager and each installation of the Denodo Platform can have a different update installed, as long as they all have the Jun, 2018 update (20180611) or later. For example, the Solution Manager can have the update 7.0 20180926 and the Denodo Platform servers, the 7.0 20181011 update. 

-  The Solution Manager |version| GA (no updates) is only compatible with Denodo Platform servers |version| GA (no updates) *and viceversa*.

-  The Solution Manager |version| is incompatible with Denodo Platform servers of earlier major versions (6.0, 5.5...).
