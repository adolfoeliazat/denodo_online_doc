Administration
==============

In order to change the configuration of the Web Panel and manage the available 
web applications, an administrator must access the application through this 
link: ``<protocol>://<host>:<port>/webpanel/#/admin`` 
(e.g. http://localhost:19090/webpanel/#/admin). The 
:doc:`next section <authentication/authentication>` explains how to be
authenticated as an administrator.
