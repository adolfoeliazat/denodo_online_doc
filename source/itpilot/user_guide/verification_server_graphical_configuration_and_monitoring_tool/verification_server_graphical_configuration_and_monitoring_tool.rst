Denodo provides a graphical configuration and monitoring tool that can
be used in production time to monitor the actions of the Verification
Server, once the Wrapper Server is running.



The remainder of this chapter explains how to configure the different
rules and tests for each wrapper loaded in the Wrapper Server (as it was
already explained in section :ref:`Rules Configuration`), the different
parameters of the graphical tool, and how to monitor the wrappers that
have been configured to be verified in the Wrapper Server.
