Adding Extensions
=================

To add a new extension to the environment click the button “Add” in the
extensions management screen or use the menu option “File > Add
extension…”. A dialog for the selection of the extension will appear.
Please select the JAR file that is going to be installed and click Open.
Alternatively, you can drag and drop the extension jar file on the
workspace area at the main window of the ITPilot Wrapper Generation
Tool.



If there is no conflict when installing the extension it will
immediately appear in the Extensions list, and the installed functions
will be available for use in the tool.



If the extension being installed already exists in the environment, an
override acknowledgement will be asked in a dialog; selecting Ok will
remove the previous extension and replace it with the newer version
being imported.
