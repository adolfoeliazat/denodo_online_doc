.. rubric:: Description

This component allows executing a short program written in JavaScript
(see :doc:`/itpilot/developer/index`).

This is a very useful option for adding small scriptlets to the process
flow when it is not possible or not worth it to create a customized
component. It is also useful when the JavaScript code generated by
ITPilot must be modified manually, and it is required that flow
regeneration does not remove the changes. In that case, code updates can
be included in a Script component, so that they are not overwritten when
re-generating the wrapperâ€™s code.
