In this section and the following one, we explain the use of the
Generation Environment tools through an example: creating a wrapper to
access a webmail application and extract e-mail data.



The first part of the example (section :ref:`Generation Environment Tools -
Part I`) provides the basic and common capacities of almost any Web
wrapper, whereas the second (section :ref:`Generation Environment Tools -
Part II`) focuses on more advanced topics that provide the tools with
greater power and versatility.



The section :ref:`Generating Navigation Sequences` provides more detail
about one of the crucial processes involved in creating wrappers: the
graphical recording of navigation sequences.
