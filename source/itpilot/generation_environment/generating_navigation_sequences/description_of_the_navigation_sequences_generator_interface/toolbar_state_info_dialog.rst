Toolbar State Info Dialog
=========================

The Toolbar State Info dialog is organized in three tabs:



-  *Last Recorded Sequence*: displays the NSEQL commands of the last
   recorded sequence.
   The lower panel displays the NSEQL commands that perform the same
   navigations as the commands in the top panel, using GET and POST HTTP
   requests.
-  *Examples*: displays a list of the examples that the user has marked
   for the data extraction process (see section :ref:`Defining the structure
   of the data and assigning examples`). Use the list on the left to
   see information of every example. For each of them, the user can
   inspect the values assigned to every field and the Navigation
   Elements.
-  *Extractor Sequences*: displays a list of the Extractor Sequences
   that the user has recorded (see section :ref:`Recording a navigation
   sequence`). Use the list on the left to see information of every
   sequence. For each of them, the user can inspect the recorded
   sequence and the transformed sequence, depending on the fields of the
   structure of the Extractor component.
