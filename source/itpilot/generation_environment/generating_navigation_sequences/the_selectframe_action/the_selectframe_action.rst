======================
The SelectFrame Action
======================

When the generated sequence is going to be used to access a multi-frame
page from which data is going to be extracted using the ”Extractor”
component (see section :ref:`Configuration of the Extractor Component` and
:doc:`/itpilot/dextl/index`),
one final step must be followed before ending the sequence. This step
consists in selecting the frame in which the data to be extracted are
found.



To do this, after completing the navigation sequence and before saving
it on disk and returning to normal mode, the user should follow the
steps below:

#. Use the mouse to highlight any text from the frame to be selected.
#. Select the *SelectFrame* action.
#. Now save and finish the sequence in the usual manner.
