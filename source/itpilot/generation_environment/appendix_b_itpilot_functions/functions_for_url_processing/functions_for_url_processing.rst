Functions for URL Processing
============================

-  ``ENCODE``: This function receives an ``URL``-type value as an
   argument and encodes it. This is necessary when different characters
   to those accepted by URLs are to be used. This function
   automatically transforms invalid characters into their corresponding
   encoding.
-  ``TOURL``: This function receives a string-type value representing an
   URL, and returns it converted into an ``URL``-data type value.
-  ``URLTOSTRING``: This function receives an ``URL``-type value as an
   argument and obtains its content as a string value.
