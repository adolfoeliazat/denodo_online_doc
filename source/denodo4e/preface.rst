Scope
=====

The Denodo Platform includes the plugin "Denodo4E". This plugin helps developers to create, deploy *and more importantly*, debug the custom extensions for the Denodo Platform. The ability to debug an extension at runtime makes the development of extensions easier.

This guide explains how to use the plugin for the Eclipse IDE "Denodo4E", it does not explain how to develop these extensions. For more information about the APIs that Denodo provides, see:

-  The section :ref:`Developing Extensions` of the "Virtual DataPort Developer Guide".
-  The section :ref:`Creating Custom ITPilot Functions` of the "ITPilot Developer Guide".


Who Should Use This Document

This document is aimed at developers of Denodo that want to develop custom extensions for Virtual DataPort or ITPilot.

Summary of Contents
