==================================
Exporting to a Repository of Files
==================================

Starting with Virtual DataPort 5.0, the folder structure created when
**exporting to a repository** of files in the local file system was simplified.

In Denodo 5.5 and 6.0, you can use the folder structure of older versions by adding the
parameters
``--property legacyRepositoryLayout=yes`` and
``--property caseSensitive=no`` to the script.

Denodo 7.0 no longer supports these parameters.

See the section :doc:`Using the Import/Export scripts for backup and/or
replication <../../../../vdp/administration/cluster_architectures_server_backup/using_the_import_export_scripts_for_backup_and_or_replication/using_the_import_export_scripts_for_backup_and_or_replication>` 
of the Administration Guide to get additional
information about these options.
