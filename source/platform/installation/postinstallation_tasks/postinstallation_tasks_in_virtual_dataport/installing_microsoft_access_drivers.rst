Installing the Microsoft Access Driver
======================================

In order to retrieve data from Microsoft Access, Virtual DataPort requires the Access ODBC drivers.

If Access is installed on the same host as the Virtual DataPort server, you do not need to do anything else (when you install Access, its drivers are also installed).

If Access is not installed on the host where the Virtual DataPort server runs, install the `Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable <https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13255>`_.
