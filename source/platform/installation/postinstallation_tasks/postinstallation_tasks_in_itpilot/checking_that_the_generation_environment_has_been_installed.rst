Checking that the Generation Environment Has Been Installed
===========================================================

The module ITPilot Generation Environment installs a toolbar in the
Internet Explorer browser that is used to aid in the wrapper generation
process (recording browsing sequences and generating data extraction
programs).

Follow these steps to check that the toolbar was installed correctly:

#. Launch Microsoft Internet Explorer.
#. The navigation sequences generator toolbar should be visible on the
   browser.
   
   If it is not, activate it by clicking **Sequence Generator** in the 
   **View > Toolbars** menu.

See the section :ref:`Enabling Internet Explorer Sequence Generation Toolbar
in Microsoft Windows Server 2008` to enable the toolbar in Microsoft
Windows 2008.

.. note:: If several versions of the platform have been installed in the
   same machine, only the Sequences Generator Toolbar of one version should
   be enabled in Internet Explorer at the same time.
