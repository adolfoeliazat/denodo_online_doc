=======================================
Defining the Data Movements of the View
=======================================

The Data Movement optimization provides a way to execute federated
queries more efficiently. When a query involves two views and one of
them is much larger than the other, Virtual DataPort can transfer the
data of the smaller view into the data source of the larger view and
execute the operation in the second data source. This may offer great
performance improvements.

The section :ref:`Data Movement` explains how Data movement works and how to
use it.
