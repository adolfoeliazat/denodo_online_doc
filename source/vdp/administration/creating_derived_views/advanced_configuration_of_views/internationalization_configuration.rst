==================================
Internationalization Configuration
==================================

The internationalization configuration (i18n) of a base view is used in
some types of sources to retrieve data properly. 

To change the internationalization configuration of a base view, open
the **Options** dialog of the view, click the tab **Search methods** and
select the appropriate **i18n**. The i18n of derived views cannot be
changed. 

The section :ref:`Configuring the Default Internationalization` explains how this setting affects the queries that return date values.
