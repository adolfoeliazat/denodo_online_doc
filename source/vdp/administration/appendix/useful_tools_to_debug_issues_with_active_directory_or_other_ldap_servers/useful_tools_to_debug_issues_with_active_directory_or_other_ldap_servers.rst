Useful Tools to Debug Issues with Active Directory or Other LDAP Servers
========================================================================

The following tools are useful to debug issues related to the
authentication of users with Active Directory or other LDAP servers:

-  `Microsoft Active Directory Explorer <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer>`_ (Windows Sysinternals Active Directory
   Explorer) is an advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer and editor. You
   can use AD Explorer to easily navigate an AD database, define
   favorite locations, view object properties and attributes without
   having to open dialog boxes, edit permissions, view an objectâ€™s
   schema, and execute sophisticated searches that you can save and
   re-execute. This tool can help you debug problems you may run into
   when setting-up the Kerberos authentication.

-  `JXplorer <http://jxplorer.org/>`_ is a cross platform LDAP browser and editor. It is a
   general-purpose LDAP client that can be used to
   search, read and edit any standard LDAP directory.
