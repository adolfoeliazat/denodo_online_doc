====================================
Enabling the Cost-Based Optimization
====================================

The cost-based optimization is enabled by default, but it can be
disabled in the “Queries optimization” dialog of the menu
“Administration > Server configuration” (see section :doc:`/vdp/administration/server_administration_-_configuring_the_server/queries_optimization/queries_optimization`).

To enable/disable this optimization for a specific database, click
**Database management** in the **Administration** menu, select the
database and click **Edit**. Then, select **Automatic cost based
optimization on** or **off** and click **Ok**. In this dialog, if
“Automatic cost-based optimization” is **Default**, the database has the
configuration defined in the “Queries optimization” dialog.
