============================
Creating an LDAP Data Source
============================

Create an LDAP data source that points to the Active Directory. The
section :ref:`LDAP Sources` explains how to do this. At runtime, Virtual
DataPort will use this data source to retrieve from the Active Directory
the roles of each user that connects to Virtual DataPort.

Make sure that the credentials defined in this data source have enough
privileges to search the credentials of all the users and search their
roles.
