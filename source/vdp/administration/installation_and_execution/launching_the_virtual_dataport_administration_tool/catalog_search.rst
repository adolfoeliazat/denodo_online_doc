The Catalog Search tool searches all the elements in the catalog of the
current Virtual DataPort server database. It is located in the menu
“Tools > Catalog Search”.

The criteria for searching elements are the following:

-  **Element Type**. If the selected element type is “Views”, the user
   can also select “View Type”, “Swap active” and “Cache Status” as
   search criteria.
-  **Owner**. User name of the user that created the elements.
-  **Last User Modifier**. User name of the last user that modified the
   elements.
-  **Initial Creation Date** and **End Creation Date**. Elements that
   were created between the “Initial Creation Date” and the “End
   Creation Date”.
-  **Initial Modification Date** and **End Modification Date**. Elements
   that were modified between the “Initial Modification Date” and the
   “End Modification Date”.
-  **Description**. Elements that contain the value of this field in its
   description.

It is possible to open the configuration of an element included in the
results by clicking on its name.
