The tab “Search” allows you to search all the data of all the views and web services of
the Virtual DataPort server.

It is possible to perform two types of searches:

- :ref:`Catalog Search <data_catalog_catalog_search>`
- :ref:`Content Search`

Depending on the kind of search (catalog or content), you can make :ref:`different queries <Queries>`.
