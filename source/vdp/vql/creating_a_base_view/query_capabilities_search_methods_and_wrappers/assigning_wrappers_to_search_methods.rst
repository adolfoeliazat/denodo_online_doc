====================================
Assigning Wrappers to Search Methods
====================================

As can be seen in the syntax of :ref:`Syntax of the statement
ALTER TABLE`, to assign a *wrapper* to a search method two elements
must be indicated: the *wrapper* type and the name of same.

The type of *wrapper* indicates the nature of the external source from
which the data are extracted. Details on how to create a *wrapper* are
provided in the section :ref:`Generating Wrappers and Data Sources`.
