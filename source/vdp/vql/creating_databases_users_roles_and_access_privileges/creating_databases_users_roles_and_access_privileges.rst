A Virtual DataPort server can contain several databases (do not confuse
with the external databases that can act as data sources). These
databases represent virtual schemas comprised of data sources, views,
stored procedures, etc.

This section does not explain all the concepts related with databases,
users, roles and their access privileges. It only explains the VQL
statements to manage them. The section :doc:`/vdp/administration/databases_users_and_access_rights_in_virtual_dataport/databases_users_and_access_rights_in_virtual_dataport` of the Administration Guide explains in detail all these
concepts.

To manage the databases, users, roles and their privileges, of a Virtual
DataPort server, you need to connect to the server using an
administrator-type user.
