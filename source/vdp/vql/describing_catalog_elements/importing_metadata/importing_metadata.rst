==================
Importing Metadata
==================

To import the exported metadata, you need to execute the VQL statements
obtained during the export process. There are two options to do this:

#. Using the “Import” dialog of the administration tool. See section
   :ref:`Importing Metadata into a Server` of the Administration Guide.
#. Or, use the import script. See section :ref:`Import Script` of the
   Administration Guide.
