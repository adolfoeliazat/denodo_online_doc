The SQL Structured Query Language is a standardized database language
supported by most relational database managers available on the market.

Virtual DataPort provides a language called Denodo VQL *(Denodo Virtual
Query Language)* which extends SQL with the required capabilities in a
distributed information integration environment.

VQL, like SQL, is composed of commands, clauses, operators and
aggregation functions. These elements are combined in the instructions
to create, update and manipulate databases. This section describes the
commands, clauses, operators and syntax of VQL.
