Comments
========

You can add comments to your VQL statements. There are two types of
comments

-  Single-line comments: begin the comment with two hyphens (``--``) or a
   hash (``#``). The rest of the line will be a comment.
-  Multiline comments: begin the comment with a slash and an asterisk
   (``/*``) and end it with an asterisk and a slash (``*/``). The
   comment can span multiple lines.
