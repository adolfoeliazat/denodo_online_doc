The Diagnostic & Monitoring Tool supports two sets of settings that a user can
configure:

#. :doc:`User configuration <./user_configuration/user_configuration>` controls how the Diagnostic &
   Monitoring Tool presents information to the user. For instance, you can adjust
   the series each graph will display or the default polling interval for tables.
   These parameters are available to every user and will only affect the user who
   made the change.

#. :ref:`Server configuration <Server Configuration>` contains the settings that
   affect behavior of the server and, therefore, every user. Only the administrators
   of the Diagnostic & Monitoring Tool have access to this configuration.
