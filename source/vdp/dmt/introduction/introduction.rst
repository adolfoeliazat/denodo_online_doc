Virtual DataPort exposes management information of the server with
:ref:`its Java Management eXtensions (JMX) interface
<Monitoring with a Java Management Extensions (JMX) Agent>`. You
can access this information in real-time with a `JMX
<https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html>`_
client like :ref:`JavaTM VisualVM <Using JavaTM VisualVM>`. Nevertheless,
this information is distributed through several
management objects called MBeans, which group together related data, an
easy way for machines to access the data, but not for people.

The :ref:`Denodo Monitor` gathers
information about the Virtual DataPort servers for a later analysis.
When a problem occurs, you have all the information you need to find its
cause. However, browsing the logs directly is a tedious task that can
suppose a great effort.

The **Diagnostic & Monitoring Tool** tackles both issues:

#. :doc:`Monitoring <../monitoring/monitoring>`: it displays real-time information of one or more
   Virtual DataPort servers.
#. :ref:`Diagnostic <Diagnosing>`: it processes log files generated by Virtual DataPort
   servers and the Denodo Monitor to help diagnosing past problems.

This document explains how to use this tool.
